Name: Zhongxun Liu
URL: https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching/candidate/orIsTcsEM
Reason: Zhongxun Liu does not have any direct experience in biomedical, biotechnology, robotics, or healthcare as
described in the text. His primary experiences are in materials engineering and SaaS platforms related
to vacation rental management (StayPro) and laser cladding solutions for industrial use (OceanShield). The only
somewhat relevant experience is his participation in a research project aimed at developing laser cladding
coatings to combat ship corrosion, which led him to be listed as an co-inventor on
a US patent. However, this does not count as actual experience within the specified domains
of biomedical, biotechnology, robotics (beyond industrial use), or healthcare based on the criteria provided.

Date: 2025-10-12 14:43:44
Name: Bren Kugamoorthy
URL: https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching/candidate/4AeIFERzL
Reason: Bren has relevant experience in the biomedical and healthcare fields. He holds a degree in
Sport medicine from the University of Toronto, indicating formal education in health sciences. His work
background includes roles such as director of performance with organizations like the NBA, NCAA, TEAM
Canada, and the Olympics, suggesting hands-on experience in human health optimization and potentially medical device
use or development, given his role. The Elev8 project he is working on involves developing
a device that heals tendon tissues, which directly pertains to biomedical engineering and healthcare product
development. This indicates practical involvement with medical devices aimed at improving human performance and longevity.
Additionally, the mention of "Robotics" among shared interests, combined with his background in sports science
and technical product development (Elev8), suggests there could be a robotic or automated component to
his work, but specific robotics experience was not detailed. Overall, Bren has direct experience in
biomedical and healthcare areas relevant to the criteria set out.
